# Retail-Management
Online retailers can increase their sales and profits faster than a brick and mortar shop as selling online offers the advantage of having 
an open store, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. This advantage allows online retailers to expand their market to global 
proportions or target an extremely focused segment. To gain profit in online retailing, it is important to set business strategies focusing
customer buying attitude along with the sales’ trends. In this project we aimed to perform exploratory analysis on ‘Online Retail’ data set
to predict different trends of purchased online products. Based on the exploratory analysis, this project aims to visualize forecast future
selling trend.
